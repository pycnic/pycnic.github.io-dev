Digital assets abound and come in diverse flavors.
For example, a digital asset can be a blog post, a scientific article, a
software package.
Specific repositories store digital assets of the same type.
A blog stores blog posts, a scientific journal stores scientific articles, a
software package repository stores you name it.
With storing a great number of digital assets comes the task of describing the
content of each asset and the relation of assets in a systematic way.
This meta-information facilitates retrieval of the desired asset as well as
exploration of the repository.

Many systems in general and blogging systems in particular provide *categories*
and [*tags*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)#Knowledge_tags) to
classify their contents.
Categories serve as thematically broad entry points and navigation to the
reader.
A category page is a distinct sub-blog, like a
newspaper section.
Tags on the other hand classify the ingredients of each piece across categories,
each post should have as many tags as relevant to its content.

To summarize, *categories bind the content to a specific outlet (output), tags
classify the content itself (or the input)*.
